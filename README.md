# Credit card fraud detection using machine learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.

Dataset
The dataset used is creditcard.csv. It contains 31 features:

Time: The time elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1, V2, ..., V28: The result of a PCA transformation, ensuring anonymity.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Class: The class label (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).
